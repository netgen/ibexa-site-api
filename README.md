**Netgen's Site API** is a productivity layer built for Ibexa developers, designed to
remove the need for boilerplate code and make the development of Ibexa sites more accessible
and less fallible.

By removing the need to write PHP to solve common problems, Site API enables less technical people
and other developers beside PHP ones to do more - such as content creators, project managers and
frontend developers. With its PHP API it also simplifies things for PHP developers, freeing them
from having to continually reinvent the wheel and giving them more time to spend on the custom
backend logic.
